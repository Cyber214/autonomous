What NOT to change now

Do not add more indicators

Do not loosen filters

Do not optimize for more trades

Do not retrain models yet

Any of those will likely reduce this edge.

What to do next (in correct order)
1. Robustness check (mandatory)

Run the same setup on:

Different symbol

Different timeframe

Different market condition (range / trend)

If win rate stays ≥55% and PF ≥ 1.5, the edge is real.

2. Lock the strategy

Freeze:

ADX threshold

Passing mark

FVG logic

Risk rules

Version it. Do not touch while testing execution.

3. Move to Bybit testnet execution

Now—not before—you connect:

Bybit WebSocket (prices)

Bybit REST (orders, SL, TP)

Same logic. Same rules. No new ideas.
